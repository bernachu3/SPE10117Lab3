Paper: [Cyber physical ecommerce logistics system: An implementation case in Hong Kong](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835219306394)

1. Ecommerce is a vital part of Hong Kong's economy, however the city's infrastructure has stalled. The paper introduces and recommends the system CPeLS for improving the city's logistics
2. Keywords:
+ Ecommerce logistics park
+ Cloud computing
+ Smart management
3. The paper recommends cloud computing with an intelligent coordination system that can manage and handle logistics autonomously. The document goes in-depth on the specifics of how the system functions but manages to avoid using too technical language so that the everyman can follow it.
4. Strengths: The authors identified possible issues from this system as well as consideration for how it might be implemented , which shows they have considered aspects such as practicality.
5. Weaknesses: There are a few grammatical mistakes which, while it does not affect the legibility of the document, undermines the effectiveness of its message. 
6. I learned that there are many parts that go into making a logistics system work, and I have also learned that mainland China is more embracing of new technologies than Hong Kong.
